# Note Taker
Creating a website that allows you to take notes and store them on a deployed heroku server

### Introduction:
A simple note taker than allows users to create and delete notes. These notes are then saved on a server to be accessed at a later date. This is a public server, so anyone is allowed to use them who can access the website.

### Here is the final product:
